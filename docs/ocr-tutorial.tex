\chapter{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

This tutorial is about current OCR technologies, and Niko Partanen's own practices when building new OCR models. These are not necessarily \emph{best practices}, but certainly on a road toward that, and all feedback that helps improving the methodology presented here is most welcome.

All examples are taken from the National Library of Finland's \href{https://fennougrica.kansalliskirjasto.fi/}{Fenno-Ugrica collection}.

This workshop assumes that the participants are comfortable with installing software from the source, and are used to working on command line. All examples are supposed to be complete and repeatable, but this is very much ongoing work.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

This workshop will be built around the materials presented by \citet{partanen2019ocr}. That study contained few experiments with training \href{https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy}{Ocropy} models for various languages for which Unified Northern Alphabet was used. The result was that bootstrapping of a new OCR system is extremely fast when the domain is very narrow, i.e.~font is known, and there are enough examples of different characters. The study also showed that the system performed comparably well in monolingual and multilingual conditions, indicating that having an OCR system for this writing system, and not one for each language using it, should be a reasonable goal for further work.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

In Chapter \ref{tools} I go through the main tools we can currently use in OCR. Handwritten text recognition, HTR, is somewhat beyond the capabilities of this software, and in that domain \href{https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/}{Transkribus} system has a very strong position. Thereby that is discussed separately in section \ref{htr}.

Since text recognition is closely connected to layout analysis, that is discussed in \ref{layout}. I have not personally explored much the field of layout detection, although there certainly is a lot to gain in that front. I would even say that most of our current technical problems relate to layout analysis, more than text recognition itself.

In order to start training the models, we need to acquire or create Ground Truth datasets. These are discussed, through various examples, in Chapter \ref{ground-truth}.

In the Chapter \ref{training} I finally get into actual model training, and in the Chapter \ref{using-models} I provide examples and code for using the models we trained. As will be shown, proofreading Ground Truth and training the model creates a very fast and rewarding loop, where generating more data that improves the model gets increasingly faster.

Comments, corrections and additions are more than welcome, either by email (niko.partanen@helsinki.fi), or through GitHub Issues in the project repository.

\hypertarget{tools}{%
\chapter{Tools}\label{tools}}

The OCR tools discussed here are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ocropy
\item
  Calamari
\item
  Tesseract
\end{itemize}

I will not discuss Abbyy FineReader at length, besides saying that even though it fits well to casual use, I think it is not really the best choice for creating scientific datasets that are discussed here.

In the end of the workshop also Transkribus is discussed. It is a very exciting project that has derived impressive results on handwritten text recognition. It is very recommandable to take a look into it.

\hypertarget{layout}{%
\chapter{Layout analysis}\label{layout}}

It is important to understand that OCR systems Ã¡re primarily about working with the text content itself, traditionally at character level, but at the moment line is the normal minimum unit. The system takes a line and returns the predicted text, but it is an entirely different question how we retrieve these lines.

I would even say that OCR itself is much more a solved problem than layout detection. If we have nice lines getting out from them a relatively high accuracy text is very easy. But with complex documents a lots of work is still left in finding all the text areas, lines within them, and how all those connect together into nice running text.

Of course the argument can also be made that for variety of purposes it is not even crucial to have the lines and sections connect to one another perfectly. This could be the case, for example, in topic detection tasks etc. It is important not to fall into trap where we think that as something doesn't work perfectly we cannot use it.

Indeed, as the OCR model training does not care about anything beyond an individual line, it is not of any importance there how the lines connect to one another and whether the texts are complete.

When we use the OCR model, see section \href{./doing-ocr}{Doing OCR}, it is necessary that the lines we get from the line segmentation tool we use are similar to the lines we did the model training with. Thereby it is important to think about the whole pipeline before getting too far.

In my experience the Tesseract's layout analysis tool is very good, and often gives a very sensible result. Also Transkribus has some excellent layout detection capabilities. So running the layout detection in these programs, and extracting the line bounding boxes from the XML returned is a good option. In section \href{./doing-ocr}{Doing OCR} I also have an example of how to run the whole pipeline in Python.

\hypertarget{ground-truth}{%
\chapter{Ground Truth creation}\label{ground-truth}}

The main challenge in creating Ground Truth is that we need a comfortable environment for doing the proofreading, with safety that we know the software used will save the edited file back without any structural changes.

Lots of programmers have got the idea to build their own proofreading environment. In practice this is very complicated. Tools that allow editing beyond individual lines usually break something in the XML structure.

In principle proofreading tools / environment can be extremely simple, and this is illustrated by Ocropy in the next section.

\hypertarget{examples}{%
\section{Examples}\label{examples}}

We have training data in folders \texttt{data/batch\_1\_orig}, \texttt{data/batch\_2\_orig}, \texttt{data/batch\_3\_orig}, \texttt{data/batch\_4\_orig}, \texttt{data/batch\_5\_orig} and \texttt{data/batch\_6\_orig}. Each batch has 2 pages.

We are using Ocropy in this section, so please install Ocropy.

This is the starting position:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/ocropy_starting_point.jpg}
\caption{Just scanned images}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
ocropus-nlbin ./example/batch_1_orig/*.png -o ./example/batch_1
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/ocropy_binarized_pages.jpg}
\caption{Binarized pages}
\end{figure}

This tool can be used to create segmented lines. The system stores somehow information about the line locations, but moving the files around is apparently not a good idea.

\begin{verbatim}
ocropus-gpageseg ./example/batch_1/*.bin.png
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/ocropy_segmented_lines.jpg}
\caption{Segmented lines}
\end{figure}

Now, let's pretend we are without any OCR system for this script. Then we would need to add start writing from the scratch. This could be started with the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
ocropus-gtedit html ./example/batch_1/*/*.png -o ./example/batch_1.html
\end{verbatim}

This outputs an HTML file:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/ocropy_created_html.jpg}
\caption{HTML file appears}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/ocropy_empty_html.jpg}
\caption{Empty HTML from Ocropy (\textbf{has to be edited in Firefox})}
\end{figure}

However, as we have a model from an earlier work, let's use it for now.

\begin{verbatim}
ocropus-rpred -Q 4 -m ../unified-northern-alphabet-ocr/models/ocropy/mixed_model.pyrnn.gz ./example/batch_1/*/*.bin.png
\end{verbatim}

As we already see from output, the result is sensible:

\begin{verbatim}

INFO:  ./example/batch_1/0001/010007.bin.png:lavs:

\end{verbatim}

These lines are saved with the images.

\includegraphics{./images/ocropy_export_from_html.jpg}

If we edit the HTML, and the save the file, the edited lines can be saved. This happens with:

\begin{verbatim}
ocropus-gtedit extract -O ./example/batch_1.html
\end{verbatim}

This saves the edited lines with extension \texttt{.gt.txt}.

\includegraphics{./images/ocropy_export_gt.jpg}

In this point we can do:

\begin{verbatim}
cat example/batch_1/**/*gt.txt | wc -l
> 48
\end{verbatim}

More than enough! Let's go onward!

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{.txt} files are collected to the HTML
\item
  Proofread lines are exported from HTML
\item
  The wanted outcome is pairs of \texttt{.bin.png} and \texttt{.gt.txt} files
\item
  These can be used when training the models
\end{itemize}

The idea is that you go now to section @ref(training\} about model training, train the first model with what we have, and then the workflow described here is applied to \texttt{batch\_2}.

\hypertarget{training}{%
\chapter{OCR Model training}\label{training}}

Once we have a ground truth dataset, we can start the model training.
Most of the time this is relatively simple process, and we just run the training command and tell it where the training files are, and how we want to name the model. The system we use takes care of image preprocessing, which will then be applied also when the model is used.

There are few things we usually should keep in mind while training the model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Documenting which training files are used

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Use Git commit hash in model name?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Checkpoint frequency

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Too high eats your harddisk space
  \item
    Too low is maybe difficult to monitor
  \item
    As the model accuracy can go up and down pretty wildly, it is important to notice when it is in the period of confusion, and use the model before or after that
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If you have lots of data (10,000--100,000 lines), then let it train for as long as you can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Same if you want to release something more publicly
  \item
    \textbf{Hot take:} With small amount of data nothing significant happens after first few hours. If you are in Ground Truth creation loop, iterating the new models fast is a good idea.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{training-calamari}{%
\section{Training Calamari}\label{training-calamari}}

First, install \href{https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari}{Calamari}, something like:

\begin{verbatim}
pip install calamari_ocr
pip install tensorflow 
\end{verbatim}

Or:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari
conda env create -f environment_master_cpu.yml
\end{verbatim}

Calamari model can be trained with a following command:

\begin{verbatim}
calamari-train --files train/*png --output_model_prefix komi-test- --output_dir models/ --checkpoint_frequency 200
\end{verbatim}

This would save the model into path \texttt{models/komi-test-000200...}. New model would be saved every 200 training steps. The models can be fairly large.

With our demo dataset there is the problem that Ocropy and Calamari prefer bit different filenames, so that Calamari doesn't want \texttt{.bin.png} ending. So let's collect the files we have into one folder, that is a nice practice anyway. I often do it with Bash like this:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir train

for gt_line in `ls ./example/*/*/*gt.txt`

do

  bin_png=$(echo $gt_line | sed 's/gt.txt/bin.png/g')
  png=$(echo $gt_line | sed 's/gt.txt/png/g')

  cp $gt_line ./train/"${gt_line##*/}"
  cp $bin_png ./train/"${png##*/}"

done
\end{verbatim}

So we just find all Ground Truth lines, and rename + copy them into directory \texttt{train}. We could, in this point, split it into \texttt{train} and \texttt{test}, but as the data is less than 50 lines, this is maybe a bit early. It is a good idea to use tools like SciKit Learn's \texttt{train\_test\_split} in Python, but in this point it isn't that complicated what we are doing.

In the case of our demo dataset, the command would be:

\begin{verbatim}
calamari-train --files train/*png --output_model_prefix una-batch_1- --output_dir models/ --checkpoint_frequency 200

Then the training starts, and what we get it something like:

Of course the system is only repeating the same small number of lines, so it eventually just learns them.

After having it run 2000 steps we stop, and let's test that model:

\begin{verbatim}
calamari-predict --checkpoint ./models/una-batch_1-00002000.ckpt.json --files ./mixed/*.png
\end{verbatim}

Then we test it:

\begin{verbatim}
calamari-eval --gt ./mixed/*.gt.txt
\end{verbatim}

What we get is:

Error rate of 24.43\% means that every fourth character needs to be fixed, but that is already much better than what we had in the beginning.

\hypertarget{training-tesseract}{%
\section{Training Tesseract}\label{training-tesseract}}

Training Tesseract can be a bit intimidating process. In last years many improvements have been done, and at the moment training is possible on both Linux and Mac. There is, additionally, \href{https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesstrain}{tessmake} project that very conveniently wraps the training process into a Makefile.

\begin{verbatim}
make training MODEL_NAME=komi-test GROUND_TRUTH_DIR=train/
\end{verbatim}

If you want to change the parameters, play around with the Makefile.

This gives a very good Tesseract model if you have enough data. The models, to be foundable for Tesseract, have to be in so called tessdata directory. This can be also specified when using Tesseract by specifying \texttt{-\/-tessdata-dir}.

\hypertarget{htr}{%
\chapter{Handwritten text recognition}\label{htr}}

At the moment \href{https://transkribus.eu}{Transkribus} project offers the best platform for handwritten text recognition, as well as for lots of OCR related tasks. Training also OCR models with the Transkribus system seems to work extremely, even ridiculously, well, so that is certainly worth playing around.

One example of how collections edited in Transkribus can be made available can be seen in this interface for \href{https://transkribus.eu/r/kansallisarkisto/}{National Archives of Finland}'s data.

Experiments on Finnish dialectal transcription have also been very promising.

\hypertarget{using-models}{%
\chapter{Using OCR models}\label{using-models}}

In this section we go through with practical examples how OCR models can be used.chr

\hypertarget{using-tesseract}{%
\section{Using Tesseract}\label{using-tesseract}}

Tesseract can be used as:

\begin{verbatim}
tesseract image.jpg image -l kpv alto
\end{verbatim}

This works when we have language model called \texttt{kpv} in so-called Tessdata directory. Directory can also be specified as an argument. To get XML output, one can have \texttt{alto} or \texttt{hocr} in the end of the command.

R has \href{https://docs.ropensci.org/tesseract/}{Tesseract bindings} that work well.

\href{https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/}{Pytesseract} is a good option for Python. I had some problems while using different language models on it, but for layout analysis it was really convenient.

\hypertarget{using-calamari}{%
\section{Using Calamari}\label{using-calamari}}

Calamari can be used from command line, so that it is given the model and location of line images.

\begin{verbatim}
calamari-predict --checkpoint path_to_model.ckpt --files your_images.*.png
\end{verbatim}

It can also be used directly from Python.

\begin{verbatim}
from calamari_ocr.ocr import Predictor, create_dataset, DataSetType, DataSetMode
import tensorflow as tf

predictor = Predictor('./models/komi-latin-bin00004500.ckpt')

for prediction in predictor.predict_raw(images = line_list, progress_bar=False):
    print(prediction.sentence)
\end{verbatim}

More complete example could look like this:

\begin{verbatim}

def read_alto(alto_file, version = 2):
    
    tree = ET.parse(alto_file)
    root = tree.getroot()

    xmlns = {'alto': '{http://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/ns-v' + str(version) + '#}'}
    
    data = []

    unit = root.find('.//{alto}MeasurementUnit'.format(**xmlns)).text

    max_height = root.find('.//{alto}PrintSpace'.format(**xmlns)).get('HEIGHT')
    max_width = root.find('.//{alto}PrintSpace'.format(**xmlns)).get('WIDTH')

    for block in root.iterfind('.//{alto}TextBlock'.format(**xmlns)):
        
        block_id = block.get('ID')

        for line in block.iterfind('.//{alto}TextLine'.format(**xmlns)):

            content = {}

            content["block_id"] = block_id
            content["height"] = line.get('HEIGHT')
            content["width"] = line.get('WIDTH')
            content["top"] = line.get('VPOS')
            content["left"] = line.get('HPOS')
            content["unit"] = unit
            content["max_height"] = max_height
            content["max_width"] = max_width

            line_strings = []
            for string in line.findall('./{alto}String'.format(**xmlns)):
                line_strings.append(string.get('CONTENT'))
            content["text"] = ' '.join(line_strings)
            
            data.append(content)
        
    return(data)

def extract_line_array(pil_image, height, width, top, left):

    cropped_example = pil_image.crop((int(left), int(top), int(left) + int(width), int(top) + int(height)))

    cropped_example_bw = cropped_example.convert("L")
    
    image_array = numpy.array(cropped_example_bw)

    image_array_binarized = binarize_array(image_array, 150)

    #image_array_binarized = Binarizer(image_array, threshold = 150, copy=False)
    
    return(image_array_binarized)

def predict_page(page_image, alto, predictor):
    
    alto_content = read_alto(alto)
    
    pil_image = Image.open(page_image)
    
    line_list = []

    for line in alto_content:
        extracted_line = extract_line_array(pil_image, line['height'], line['width'], line['top'], line['left'])
        line_list.append(extracted_line)
    
    pred_list = []
    
    for prediction in predictor.predict_raw(images = line_list, progress_bar=False):

        pred_list.append(prediction)
        
    return(pred_list)
\end{verbatim}

Calamari returns very nicely list of confidences for each character. This info can be used, for example, to distinguish areas where the model is most confident, which seems to indicate correct script.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{images/calamari_script_detector.jpg}
\caption{Calamari used in script detection}
\end{figure}

The model used here was quite horribly bad, but still good enough for this.
